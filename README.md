This repo contains the web implementation of the [GeminiX abstraction layer](https://github.com/dpa99c/gemini-x) for using Google's Gemini AI SDK in cross-platform mobile apps on iOS, Android and Web platforms.

It is written in Typescript and wraps the [Gemini SDK for Node.js](https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/node_quickstart) to provide a client-side web implementation.

It is included as a Git submodule by:
- [Capacitor GeminiX plugin](https://github.com/dpa99c/capacitor-plugin-gemini-x) - coming soon
- [Flutter GeminiX module](https://github.com/dpa99c/flutter-gemini-x)  - coming soon
